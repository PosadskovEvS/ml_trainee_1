# Bagging and OOB score
Please, fill the lines in the code below. This is a simplified version of BaggingRegressor 
from sklearn. Please, notice, that sklearn API is not preserved.

Your algorithm should be able to train different instances of the same model class on bootstrapped datasets
and to provide OOB score for the training set.

The model should be passed as model class with no explicit parameters and no parentheses.
