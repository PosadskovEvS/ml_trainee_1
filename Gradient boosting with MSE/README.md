# Gradient boosting with MSE

Please, fill the lines in the code below. This is a simplified version of BoostingRegressor from sklearn. Please, notice, that sklearn API is not preserved.

Your algorithm should be able to train different numbers of instances of the same model class. Every target is computed according to the loss function gradient. In this particular case, loss is computed for MSE.

The model should be passed as model class with no explicit parameters and no parentheses.
